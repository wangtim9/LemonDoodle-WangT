make sure all files are in the same folder(including image files)

sometimes when I use terminal and go to AP JAVA, it takes me to the wrong one since there are two fo rsome reason. to fix that, I have to do d: and cd until I get to the right file.

Special build commands in Geany:
  compile: javac -cp doodlepad.jar "%f"
  execute: java -cp doodlepad.jar "%f"
